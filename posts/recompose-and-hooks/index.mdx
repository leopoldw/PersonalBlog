[Recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) is awesome. I've been using it on some larger React projects to supercharge functional components with shareable enhancers, some of which use features like state (yes, inside a functional component).

<Aside header={`What's an "enhancer"?`}>Both Recompose and React Hooks supply <InlineCode>enhancers</InlineCode>, aka some functionality to <InlineCode>enhance</InlineCode> a component with new features, usually in the form of additional props and handlers.</Aside>

For reasons then unknown, Recompose development has stagnated for a while. This was disappointing as the APIs it provided to create shareable, composable enhancers felt essential in a way no other React library had before. Then, shortly after the announcement of [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/Hooks-intro.html), Recompose announced that it would cease active new feature development. Things began to make sense. As per a note from core developer [Andrew Clark](https://twitter.com/acdlite):

> I created Recompose about three years ago. About a year after that, I joined the React team. Today, we announced a proposal for Hooks. Hooks solves all the problems I attempted to address with Recompose three years ago, and more on top of that. I will be discontinuing active maintenance of this package (...), and recommending that people use Hooks instead.

I've been using Hooks to build this blog, and initial impressions are that they do indeed feel like a natural evolution of Recompose - this time, provided by the [core React library](https://reactjs.org/docs/Hooks-intro.html). However, Recompose and Hooks feature substantially different APIs, so it's not immediatley obvious how to do migrate cleanly.

<Aside header="TLDR">In this post I'll outline the advantages provided by enhancer patterns shared between Recompose & Hooks, illustrated with equivalent Hooks for some popular Recompose enhancers.</Aside>

## Recompose & The Enhancer Pattern

Recompose is an enhancer library, providing convenient [Higher Order Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) (HOCs) for common React patterns, allowing us to incrementally add features and functionality to a component via [composition](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-component-composition/). This provides some significant benefits:

- Enhancers can be easily shared between components with similar concerns
- Boilerplate code is significantly reduced
- Logical complexity can be broken up into smaller, composable chunks

The Recompose pattern I'd settled on just before Hooks entered the picture looked something like this:

### Step 1 - The UI Component

Write a _logicless_ functional (or UI) component. This component should avoid containing logic statements, instead implicitly returning JSX with the assumption that the it will magically receive all the props it needs with no additional logic.


```jsx
// don't worry about where the props come from yet
const GreetingCounterUI = ({ greeting, count, incrementCounter }) => (
  <>
    <h1>{greeting}</h1>
    <div>{`You have clicked the button ${count} times`}</div>
    <button onClick={incrementCounter}>Click Me</button>
  <>
)
```

As a guideline, if your UI component has a `return` statement, you're probably not writing a strict UI component.

### Step 2 - The Enhancers

Incrementally add the props you need via enhancers. In this case, I'd like to calculate a greeting from a name, so I'd create an enhancer like this:

```jsx
const useGreeting = withProps(({ name }) => ({
  greeting: `Hello, ${name}`,
}))
```

My UI component requires some basic state, so let's add that too.

```jsx
const useCounter = withStateHanders({
  count: 0
}, {
  incrementCounter: ({ count }) => () => ({ count + 1}),
})
```

### Step 3 - Composition

Finally, tie everything together with the included `compose` helper. As you can see below, I've split what would have been one larger component into two smaller enhancers and one UI component. I can then go on to test these smaller enhancers individually, and even share some of these enhancers with other UI components if I want to.

```jsx
import { compose } from 'recompose'

const GreetingCounter = compose(
  addGreeting,
  addCounter,
  GreetingCounterUI,
)

// `compose` allows a more convenient way of wrapping components
// than this
addGreeting(addCounter(GreetingCounterUI))

// invoke like this
<GreetingCounter name="fred" />
```

## Issues with Recompose & HOCs

While Recompose is extremely useful, it does have some notable downsides.

As it is based on the HOC pattern, each enhancer is also a standalone React component. This is not an entirely ergonomic fit, for a few reasons.

Enhancer HOCs usually never render any JSX of their own, instead simply adding or altering the props passed down to the next component. These HOCs are simply vehicles for logic, so their React component shell is unnecessarily heavy.

Some HOCs supplied by Recompose suffer from an inverse issue. Enhancers such as `withState` do not store any update logic, instead simply delivering a slice of class-based functionality down to a functional component (in this case, `state` functionality). Enhancers like this serve only as a workaround for the feature limitations of functional components.

As each enhancer is a complete component, React Devtools could easily become a complete mess. A single inner component wrapped in numerous enhancers would create an unwieldy component tree - displayed as something resembling [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/). This made debugging in Devtools painful and difficult.

<LazyImage fileName="devtoolsrecompose.png" caption="Check out the catchy component names too!" />

Internally, React does not delineate between components that render their own JSX vs components that simply pass something down to an inner component. What we need is a new way to enhance our components without creating additional intermediate components in the process.

## Hooks to the rescue

Hooks manage to address HOC enhancer issues elegantly by simply being humble functions rather than full-fat React components.

They don't contain any `render` functionality, and they don't need to. Instead, they simply supply React components with _something_ they need & handle re-rendering the parent component when required. As they are simply functions, the underlying component tree is significantly decluttered.

## API Replacements

Not all the solutions below strictly involve Hooks, but they all aim to use the enhancer pattern in a consistent way.

<Aside>React docs strongly recommend starting Hook names with <InlineCode>use</InlineCode>, eg <InlineCode>useGreeting</InlineCode>. It's too soon to tell if it makes sense to stretch this nomenclature to include all enhancers (hook-based or not), but for consistency it I'm gonna do that here.</Aside>

---

## `withState`

As one of the most convenient enhancers in Recompose's arsenal, this one has earned itself a directly equivalent Hook. Both take an optional initial state and return the current state, along with a handler to replace the entire current state.

```jsx
// recompose
const useName = withState(
  `name`,
  `setName`,
  ({ initialName }) => initialName,
)

// hooks
const [name, setName] = useState(initialName)
```

---

## `withStateHanders`

While `withState` is just simple getter/setter that will completely replace the entire state each time, `withStateHanders` allows us to capture more complex logic.

Instead of providing one update function, this enhancer allows us to create custom handlers which can update the contained state in a more targeted way. These handlers can access both current props and internal state, and in return update a slice of the internal state instead of replacing it. In this way, it functions much more like calling `setState` inside a class method handler.

```jsx
const useCounter = withStateHanders(
  ({ initialValue = 0 }) => ({ counter: initialValue }),
  {
    increment: ({ counter }) => () => ({ counter: counter + 1 }),
    decrement: ({ counter }) => () => ({ counter: counter - 1 }),
  }
)
```

React provides a unique equivalent to this functionality in the form of [custom Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/Hooks-custom.html). Pleasingly, custom Hooks can do a lot more than just interact with a state object; they may combine any number of Hooks with vanilla JavaScript to form a complete, encapsulated solution for code sharing.

Custom hooks are much more general purpose than `withStateHandlers`, but for comparison here's a direct equivalent.

```jsx
const useCounter = (initialValue = 0) => {
  // custom hook uses another hook internally
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(initialValue)

  // define specific handlers, vanilla JS
  const increment = () => setCounter(counter + 1)
  const decrement = () => setCounter(counter - 1)

  // do not expose `setCounter`, only custom handlers
  return {
    counter,
    increment,
    decrement,
  }
}
```

---

## `withProps`

Recompose's `withProps` accepts input props, performs some calculations and then returns a set of output props to be merged into the component chain.

```jsx
const useGreetings = withProps({ name }) => ({
  hi: `Hello, ${name}!`,
  bye: `Goobye, ${name}`,
})
```

Since Hooks don't explicitly plug into component props like this, we can instead use a vanilla JavaScript function to encapsulate the logic found within `withProps`.

```jsx
// ssssh, not hook based ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
const useGreetings = name => ({
  hi: `Hello, ${name}!`,
  bye: `Goobye, ${name}`,
})

const { hi, bye } = useGreetings(name)
```

It's up to you to decide if you prefer creating a function which groups similar value calculations into a single return, or if you want to separate each value into it's own function.

```jsx
const useHi = name => `Hello, ${name}!`
const useBye = name => `Goodbye, ${name}!`
```

<Aside header="What? No Hook?">Structuring all our enhancers in a predictable way will help reduce mental overhead, as you don't have to keep track of what is a Hook and what isn't. It doesn't really matter, as long as they <InlineCode>enhance</InlineCode>.</Aside>

---

## `withPropsOnChange`

The enhancers above will re-run on every render. For pure functions, this can be inefficient - for any given input, the output props will always be the same.

We can avoid re-running these calculations by `memo`izing them. `withPropsOnChange` accepts a new initial argument which can be one of the following:

- An array of prop names, as strings, to perform an equality check on between renders
- A function which accepts the previous and next props, and returns a boolean (similar to `shouldComponentUpdate`)

```jsx
const useGreetings = withPropsOnChange(
  [`name`],
  ({ name }) => ({
    hi: `Hello, ${name}!`,
    bye: `Goobye, ${name}`,
  })
)
```

The evident replacement here would be the [`useMemo`](https://reactjs.org/docs/Hooks-reference.html#usememo) Hook. It takes two arguments, the first being a function and the second being an array of variables (the variables themselves, not the names as strings a-la Recompose). If any of the variables in the array change between renders, the passed function is re-run and the result is returned from `useMemo`. If not, the previously memoized value is returned.

```jsx
const useGreetingsMemoized = useMemo(() =>
  ({
    hi: `Hello, ${name}!`,
    bye: `Goobye, ${name}`,
  }),
  [name],
)
```

<Aside>The function we pass to <InlineCode>useMemo</InlineCode> does not contain include any arguments - the variables used in the calculation are instead inherited from the parent scope.</Aside>

React now also provides a [`React.memo`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo) utility to wrap pure functional components and only re-render them if any of the props change - a functional equivalent to [`React.PureComponent`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent). However, this encapsulates the entire component and not the enhancers within, so it's not as granular as we would like for this example.

---

## `withHandlers`

Handlers have historically been a bit tricky to deal with in React, since they often need to access both the arguments passed to them _and_ the current props of the component. We can `bind` the props we need to the handler, or create an anonymous inline function which calls the handler with the props in the parent scope.

```jsx
// bound function
onClick={setName.bind(name)}

// anonymous function
onClick={() => setName(name)}
```

In both instances, a new function is created on every re-render. This is inefficient and can also cause unnecessary re-renders further down the chain, as child components have no way of knowing if the new handler passed to it contains the same props it did before. As they are different functions they will always reference differently memory, and thus fail equality checks.

`withHandlers` allows us to pass handlers which have access to both the current props and any passed arguments, without having to worry about optimization. It memoizes the function and only returns a new function when the props change.

```jsx
const useSubmitHandler = withHandlers({
  submit: props => event => {
    event.preventDefault()
    submit(props)
  },
})
```

Finally, there's an official React solution. The `useCallback` Hook returns a memoized callback which only returns a new function when the provided variables also change. This ensures that function references remain consistent between renders, only changing when they need to.

```jsx
const submitHandler = useCallback(
  event => {
    event.preventDefault()
    submit(props)
  },
  [props],
)
```

## `lifecycle`

Functional components can gain access to the Component API via this enhancer. However, while there are bunch of newer lifecycle methods like [`getDerivedStateFromProps`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#static-getderivedstatefromprops), Recompose was never updated to support them.

```jsx
const useLifecycle = lifecycle({
  componentDidMount() {
    // do stuff
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    // more stuff
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    // cleanup
  }
})
```

While the full Component API still resides exclusively in `React.Component`, Hooks do provide us with equivalents for some popular lifecycle use cases, namely `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUnmount` all in one handy Hook: [`useEffect`](https://reactjs.org/docs/Hooks-effect.html).

This Hook provides an official way to trigger "side effects" and is usually run on _every_ render, however here we'll focus on equivalent functionality for the lifecycles mentioned above. The most important thing to note here is the second optional argument of `useEffect` - an array of variables used to determine when the Hook is run. for our use case, this should either be an empty array or nothing at all.

<Aside>While in this example I'm just trying to recreate older functionality, in practice the <InlineCode>useEffect</InlineCode> Hook is not a direct equivalent for these methods but instead a new paradigm for dealing with component side effects. It's best to see it a brand new tool for solving specific issues previously addressed by certan lifecycle methods.</Aside>

```jsx
// ONLY MOUNT
useEffect(() => {
  // the code here will ONCE on mount
}, []) // empty array

// MOUNT AND UNMOUNT
useEffect(() => {
  // the code here will ONCE on mount
  return () => {
    // the code here will run ONCE on unmount
  }
}, []) // empty array

// MOUNT, UPDATE AND UNMOUNT
useEffect(() => {
  // the code here will run EVERY render
  // and thus both mount and update
    return () => {
    // the code here will run ONCE on unmount
  }
})
```

## `branch`

This enhancer can render one of two components depending on the props passed from the chain.

The Recompose version of this enhancer is worth noting as it has no good equivalent Hook. While the HOC pattern has it's downsides, it works at component level and thus has control over the component provided to the enhancer. Hooks only come into effect once inside an invoked component.

```jsx
const useLoading = branch(
  ({ loading }) => loading === true,
  Loading, // if true, render this and stop the chain
  // if false, fall through to the next component
)
```

Due to this change in functionality, `branch` is best replaced by a custom component rather than a Hook.

```jsx
const Branch = ({ condition, Left, Right, ...rest }) =>
  condition
    ? <Left {...rest} />
    : <Right {...rest} />
```

## Conclusion

While this is by no means a exhaustive list of all Recompose / Hook enhancers, the examples above should illustrate their equivalency.

The enhancer pattern is incredibly useful and deserves to be part of the [official top-level API](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#hooks), as it now is with Hooks. Even though they're still fresh, I'm sold on Hooks as a Recompose replacement thanks to their simplicity, flexibility and ease of use.
